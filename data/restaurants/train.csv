;place;place;chicken tikka masala;feel	restaurant price price ambiance	 positive negative negative negative	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
;waiters	service	 negative	Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
;null;null	service price	 negative negative	I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).

;food;null	food service	 negative negative	My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.

;private booths;glass ceilings	ambiance ambiance	 positive positive	If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).

;brasserie;brasserie	restaurant price	 positive positive	Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.
;zenkichi;zenkichi	restaurant ambiance	 positive positive	I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.

;null	restaurant	 negative	Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
;decor;mirrored walls	ambiance ambiance	 negative negative	This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
;place;food	ambiance food	 negative negative	This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
;japanese tapas	food	 negative	The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
;food	food	 negative	The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.

;restaurant	restaurant	 positive	I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.
;patio;null	ambiance restaurant	 positive positive	Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
;null	restaurant	 negative	Dumbfoundingly Poor
;null	restaurant	 negative	This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
;null	service	 negative	Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
;servers	service	 negative	The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
;null	service	 negative	Polite acknowledgement is out;
;null	service	 negative	supercilious scorn is in.
;null	service	 negative	And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
;server;appetizer	service food	 negative positive	A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
;food;null	food service	 positive negative	Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
;fit-out;furnishings;wine list;null	ambiance ambiance beverages service	 positive positive positive negative	The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
;null;null;null	price restaurant service	 negative negative negative	At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
;null	restaurant	 negative	On that scale, it's a world-beater.
;palce	restaurant	 negative	How is this palce still open?
;null	restaurant	 negative	I honestly don't even know where to begin.

;null;spinach	food food	 negative negative	It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
;salmon;salmon	food price	 negative negative	I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
;waitress	service	 negative	At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.
;spinach	food	 negative	So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
;null	food	 negative	I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
;null	food	 negative	So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
;null	service	 negative	"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing."
;null	service	 negative	After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
;null	service	 negative	No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
;manager	service	 negative	This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
;null	service	 negative	Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
;null	service	 negative	The level of rudeness was preposterous.
;manager;drinks;appetizers	service beverages food	 negative positive positive	The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
;null	restaurant	 negative	I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.

;place	restaurant	 negative	If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
;null	misc	 negative	The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
;null	restaurant	 negative	Well...they can run but they can't hide.
;place	restaurant	 negative	This place...god where do i begin.
;scene	ambiance	 positive	It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
;decor;eggplant;eggplant;null	ambiance food price service	 neutral negative negative negative	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
;place	restaurant	 negative	How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.

;menu	price	 negative	Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
;spot;food	restaurant food	 positive positive	But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
;food;front of house staff	food service	 positive negative	Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
;null	price	 negative	It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
;waiters;front of house staff;fish dishes	service service food	 positive negative positive	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
;bfc;front of house staff;null	misc service service	 negative negative negative	As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
;girl	service	 negative	The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
;null	service	 negative	"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??"
;staff	service	 negative	I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
;girl	service	 negative	"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. "
;null	service	 negative	I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
;null	service	 negative	Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
;service;null	service price	 negative negative	Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
;null	service	 negative	So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
;maitre-d	service	 negative	"Maitre-D-""Eat and get out"""
;food;service;maitre-d	food service service	 positive positive negative	The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
;bottle of wine	beverages	 positive	While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
;frontman	service	 negative	This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
;null	service	 negative	His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
;maitre-d	service	 negative	"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else."
;null	service	 negative	If you go here, do it on his off-night.

;atmosphere	ambiance	 positive	Great Atmosphere
;fish tacos;null	food food	 positive neutral	I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.
;atmosphere;fire place;null	ambiance ambiance ambiance	 positive positive negative	Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
;service;management	service service	 negative negative	Poor service and management
;place	restaurant	 negative	Don’t go to this place!
;casa la femme	restaurant	 negative	Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.

;restaurant;null	price service	 negative negative	Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
;null	restaurant	 negative	What a hassle!
;food	food	 neutral	The food is very good, but not outstanding.
;staff;null;wait	service food service	 negative negative negative	There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
;null	service	 negative	On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
;staff	service	 negative	Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.
;null	price	 negative	Expensive
;bread;salad;salad	food price food	 negative negative negative	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.

;bartender	service	 negative	The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
;waitress	service	 negative	I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
;waitress	service	 negative	"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party."""
;null	service	 negative	The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
;null	misc	 negative	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
;staff;customer service	service service	 negative negative	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
;staff	service	 negative	bad staff

;waitress;waiter	service service	 negative negative	I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.
;waiter	service	 negative	The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
;null	service	 negative	I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
;waitress	service	 negative	The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
;null	service	 negative	I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
;null	service	 negative	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
;place;staff	restaurant service	 negative negative	I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
