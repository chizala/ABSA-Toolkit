			<text>The place was fantastic in every way.Just the right mix between quality service and facilities and not being too over the top.Rooms were large, very modern and had all the latest gadgets installed - 2 Lcd tv's, multi headed shower system, usual Japanese high tech toilets, powerful air-con system, comfortable beds.I have nothing to fault this hotel on.The location was excellent for getting around, the French Kitchen on the 2nd floor did a great competitive breakfast, service was spot on, and the gym and pool facilities on the 5th floor were very well ordered and surprisingly little used on the occasions I visited them.I would definately stay here again.</text>
