;txt file	 general	 positive	"i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take ."
;pictures	 picture	 positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
;flash	 picture	 negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
;powershot g3;price	 general price	 positive positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first - class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
;viewfinder	 general	 negative	* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
;automatic settings	 general	 positive	with the automatic settings , i really have n ' t taken a bad picture yet .

;null	 general	 positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
;import	 usability	 positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
;white offsets	 picture	 positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon ' s factory white - correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
;picture quality;travel size	 picture size	 positive positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature - loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
;manual mode	 usability	 positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .

;pictures;use	 picture usability	 positive positive	"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !"
;darn diopter adjustment dial	 general	 negative	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can ' t get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n ' t know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
;null	 general	 positive	i ' ve had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
;powershot g3	 general	 positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .

;distortion	 picture	 negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n ' t like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i ' m going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n ' t zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
