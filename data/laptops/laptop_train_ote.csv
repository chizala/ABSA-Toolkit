1243	;battery	  the battery is irreplaceable.

1259	;warranty	I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.

1269	;delivery service	After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.

1273	;mousepad;keys;casing	  Another THREE weeks later I had my laptop back with a new mousepad, keys, and casing.
1274	;operating system	See when it comes to laptops you buy it and get just a normal operating system with trials of must need stuff that should come with it.

1300	;shipping	(No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.

1305	;priced;works	It's priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box.
1306	;os	You will need them if you want to reload the OS (I recommend doing if you can to start fresh and optimal).

1317	;windows;warrenty;agents	Again in February my computer completely failed to the point that it could not load Windows so I contacted Acer to get it fixed thru my Warrenty and it took about 3 days fighting on the phone with agents and it seemed as though NONE of them spoke English.

1329	;hard disc	In due course, I'll remove the hard disc from this new MacBook Pro and dump it where it belongs - in the trash.
1330	;virus protection programs for a mac	They break down just as often as PCs do, and the only reason they don't get viruses, is because no one makes viruses for them, they're not better in any way, they are worse, try finding virus protection programs for a Mac, they don't exist.
1331	;screen;hdmi	But with A WAY Bigger Screen, and IS able to connect to an HDMI.
1332	;graphics;wireless switch	the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.

1342	;speakers	The speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones I have ever seen in a laptop so if your planning to listen to music I suggest you get something better.
1343	;price	So then you may be lucky to get ahold to someone who understands that its no good and they will let you send it back, but of course you are taking a chance of them testing it out to see what has happened, and they tell you that it was not on their side , then you are stuck paying for the repair (the price of a new one).
1344	;use	It is so simple to use, I use it more than my desktop.
1345	;touchpad;screen;mouse pointer	I also had a problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen.

1354	;work	4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
1355	;speakers	The only thing that isn't perfect about this netbook is the speakers, they are not loud at all but I expected that.
1356	;hinges	Of course, I inspected the other netbooks and clearly their hinges are tighter and I even demonstrate the difference between my netbook and others.
1357	;programs	Not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs.
1358	;work	Didn't work when shipped from Walmart.com but went into a store and exchanged for a working laptop (same make/model).
1359	;customer service	If this is an improvement in Customer Service then I would hate too see what it was before!
1360	;programs;keynote;pages;numbers	All of the programs (Keynote, Pages, Numbers) have an option to save your documents as Microsoft compatible, which really eliminates the need for the actual.
1361	;expense;run	Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
1362	;components;price;price	"The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google ""dell coupons"" you can find codes that take a signifant  amount off the price."
1363	;cd drive	There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
1364	;price	For me I was lucky and a local store was selling them for $2000 off and Best Buy matched their price so I was able to buy one for under $1000
1365	;quality	Unfortunately, Apple's quality has continued to slide.
1366	;quality;price	I believe that the quality of a mac is worth the price.
1367	;pointer	sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move.
1368	;shipping;price;budget	"The 13"" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product."
1369	;life span	I would rate this computer at 5 stars, but considering it has a short life span I can only give it 1 and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine.
1370	;design;looks;feel;my toshiba feature	I also love the design, the looks, the feel, and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull.

1375	;iwork;office;word processor;windows;document creation	Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of word processor (such as works for windows), but iwork is cheap compared to office.
1376	;battery	It is light and the battery last a very long time.
1377	;memory;memory stick;memory stick	  And at one point, they blame me for installing a bad memory stick when I upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop (I bought the memory stick they recomended).
1378	;keys;keyboard;button below the mouse pad;screen;paint	Externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off, after a few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit, and the screen has a terrible glare.

1380	;touchpad	The touchpad is extremely sensitive, which is the only drawback.
1381	;applications;iphoto;photo application	also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
1382	;bluetooth;fingerprint reader;screen;mic;dual touchpad mode;usb ports;webcam;use;runs	-Bluetooth (2.1), Fingerprint Reader, Full 1920x1080 screen -Integrated Mic/Webcam* -Dual touchpad mode is interesting, and easy to use -5 USB ports -Runs about 38-41C on idle, Up to 65 (for me) on load -Very quiet -I could go on and on.
1383	;word	They don t translate from a Mac, even on Word, resulting in a ton of run-on sentences.

1385	;warranty period	Summary: They played games with me for the warranty period.

1390	;graphics	The graphics are stunning.

1393	;software	You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.

1397	;screen	The only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets, and rather quickly too.
1398	;carry;weight	The laptop is very lightweight, can easily carry around in a knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight.

1408	;screen	The screen is nice, side view angles are pretty good.
1409	;screen;screen	The fact that the screen reacts to the lighting around you is an added luxury-when you are working around others in dark areas and want privacy or don't want to bother them with bright lighting, it is very convenient to have a darker, softer lit screen.

1420	;shipping;repair center	Called Acer many times, they want me to pay the shipping to ship it to their repair center - I was very disappointed since it is a brand new computer!

1436	;desktop background;window's 7 starter;function	1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
1437	;it support technicians	Took me 11 hours, 3 trips to different FedEx offices, and brutal conversations with 14 of the worse IT support technicians in the world.
1438	;charger;hardware	Then after 4 or so months the charger stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running.

1448	;screen	The screen is huge and coloful, but no LED backlighting.
